      "mobiledoc": "{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"I was reading the Turing Omnibus, doing  some research into error correction, and I learned about Hamming Codes. I might have understood the concept at the time, but today, what I remember is the offhand comment my friend made about their creator, Richard Hamming.\\n\\n> Oh you should watch his talk \\\"You and Your Research\\\"\\n\\nAt this point in my life, I'd been laid off form my first startup and was taking a break to \\\"get better at programming\\\". My goal was vague, I admit. I loved development and I'd worked very hard to get that first job (story at a later point), but I realized about 10 months into working that I was spinning my wheels. I was learning the libraries and could hook them together, but I was playing with Duplos, mentally. I didn't have the deeper understanding of computers that gave all that library code some context. I didn't understand what it was doing at any sort of level but the most superficial. And I was aware that the world in which I was traveling was moving faster and faster, which effectively made me standing still or moving backwards[^1].\\n\\n\\\"You and Your Research\\\" is a brilliant, inspirational talk, which I've since watched many times. But I'll focus on one point Hamming makes, which hit me like a brick over the head.\\n\\n> Given two people of approximately the same ability and one person who works ten percent more than the other, the latter will more than twice outproduce the former. The more you know, the more you learn; the more you learn, the more you can do; the more you can do, the more the opportunity - it is very much like compound interest.\\n\\nHe's actually making two points here, which I'll unpack.\\n\\nFirstly, because because knowledge is compounding, knowing more is a virtuous cycle. And in terms of what you choose to learn, there's a spectrum from essentially useless to rather useful. And what I mean by useful knowledge here are things that don't really change all that quickly and things you can build on. In fact not all knowledge is actually compound useful (or maybe if its not compounding knowledge its actually just trivia :thinking_face:). Thus, you should work hard to identify knowledge that does compound.\\n\\nSo, for example, learning the latest Javascript framework du-jour or the Webpack v3 module apis, would not be useful knowledge because it will likely be obsoleted by a PR from the next boot camp grad hire at your job before you've finished this paragraph. Not to say you shouldn't learn it, but I would strongly suggest learning only as little as necessary to get your job done (_Just in Time_ learning). Instead, focus on really learning Javascript, the language. Or focus on learning *Programming Languages* in the abstract. Or focus on learning C (what a shockingly elitist thing to say 😱). Or learn assembly because you'll actually have to learn how computer work to understand what's even going on (I'll grant you that some crazy freaks will tell me that even assembly is a \\\"huge abstraction\\\" and I suppose they'd be kinda right, but who wants to have a drink with them at a party....).\\n\\nThis corpus of knowledge is generally called *serious tone* **Computer Science**, which is neither about computers nor is a science (*sic(p)*). That being said, its useful great stuff, especially if you want to stop spinning your wheels and start getting somewhere. I'll tell you that stepping of the treadmill and ambling through the dustier sections of CS in the library, picking up Olde Books (like \\\"Programming Pearls\\\" or \\\"TCP/IP Illustrated\\\") taught me things that no React tutorial ever could. This old stuff gave me, for lack of a better term, intuition. And its since proved really useful working in lots of domains, from shite frontend webapps to infrastructure to devops, from mac to linux to windows.\\n\\nNow I'm not saying that the particulars don't matter; they really do. Knowing the platforms you're working on is crucial to doing good work. But what I am saying, is that spending some time with the deeper subjects will pay dividends. Dividends in your ability to read unfamiliar languages and codebases and paradigms, dividends in your ability to debug problems, and dividends in your holistic enjoyment of your work, because you'll start of see the larger picture instead of feeling like you're constantly falling behind.

      "plaintext": "Today at work I was trying to merging a PR, and I noticed something very strange \n during the rebase. I work on a team that, among other things, manages\ndependencies for applications [https://github.com/buildpack].  We define the\nversions of a runtime available to an application through a manifest, which is\nin YAML form. And part of the manifest includes SHAs of the runtimes, which we\nuse to verify their integrity.\n\nA select few of SHAs now had single quotes around them. Wat?This wasn't\nnecessarily a problem, but it was a confusing change, at the very least.  Spooky\n👻. But was it a bug? And why was it happening? I had to find out.\n\nI love  a good debug.  For the curious and patient, its a wonderfully rewarding\nexercise in problem solving. You're guaranteed to learn things about your\ncodebase and services that you run. And if you're deliberate in your approach,\nyou can learn things about debugging! Which makes you a better debugger!\nFeedback loops!\n\nOkay so I always start with questions. What's the behavior I'm seeing? Do we\nhave time to understand this or is this an emergency that we can triage later?\nAnd most importantly,\n\nWhat's changed recently?So we checked the commit of the YAML change. Automation.\nWhere are the code paths that actually write this YAML, that are invoked by our\nautomation? Hmm...nothing changed there recently. Some 2 year old Ruby code.\n\nOkay let's try and correlate this YAML change with something else. This\ntechnique roughly looks like finding when the new behavior started, and\nbacktracking to any pertinent changes that happened just before the behavior\nstarted exhibiting. Its a bit like being a detective (at least the masterpiece\ntheater type 🧐) -  you're trying to develop a timeline of the event in\nquestion, building up a picture in your mind. Don't jump on causes just yet.\nSteep yourself in information and let diffuse thinking be your guide.\n\nYou'll notice that I said pertinent  changes. In the ideal case, every aspect of\nthe environment in question is version controlled in some way, even at the\nsystem level. Luckily, our CI tasks run in docker containers. Unfortunately, we\nuse the latest tag (some shame on us), so its a bit harder to track what exactly\nwas in the container that ran the code in question, but in general the point\nstands. And we're much better off than if we have some IT provisioned snowflake\n\nGit, of course, is a great source for this information...its actually basically\nthe only source of information that's reliable. Even the release notes of your\ndependencies could be wrong, but git don't lie (at least I hope not). Git it is\nbasically the entire magic sauce to doing debugging at the unit and integration\nlevel (IE, within one codebase and then between system boundaries). If there was\na git-like thing for reality, detectives would have a much easier time. I don't\neven really know what that means; hopefully I didn't just describe the\nblockchain ▇ ⛓.\n\nAnyway, so we looked through our git log and found something that happened\naround that time: the CI image was updated from ruby:2.3.1-slim -> ruby:2.3-slim\n. Okay so that was probably it. So, next step:\n\nDevelop a hypothesis and test itThe change had something to do with YAML and\nRuby, so lets look into that. Hypothesis: some version of either libyaml  or the\nRuby YAML library (basically a thin wrapper around libyaml) got bumped with that\nCI change and its now dumping YAML differently. Not exactly a brilliant insight,\nbut its something to go on.\n\nCreate an isolated example of the bug to test your hypothesisIn my mind, you\ndon't have a bug if you can't reproduce it; you have a Heisenbug or some\ndistributed systems Gremlin. Or you're drunk. Anway, try and catch that Gremlin\nand put it in a bottle 👹. We wrote a little Ruby program that should reproduce\nthe behavior:\n\nrequire 'yaml'\n\nput YAML::VERSION\n\ntestCase = {sha: \n'0911c3aeb2c25dd0a41f0225e0c0f2baaa404ffb9cd772166133572f5fb91112'}\n\nputs YAML.dump(testCase)\n\nSo now, bug-in-a-bottle in hand, we can test our hypothesis. Here's how we\ntested it:\n\n○ → docker run -v $(pwd):/tmp/test -it cfbuildpacks/ci:latest bash -c \"cd /tmp/test && ruby test.rb\n\n2.0.17\nsha: 0911c3aeb2c25dd0a41f0225e0c0f2baaa404ffb9cd772166133572f5fb91112\n\n\n○ → ruby test.rb\n\n2.1.0\nsha: '0911c3aeb2c25dd0a41f0225e0c0f2baaa404ffb9cd772166133572f5fb91112'\n\n\nAHA⚠️ So there it is...problem isolated. But...wait that's not what we\nexpected...that's the opposite! I mean, clearly there's something to our\nhypothesis, but we were just confused at that point! Hmmm. So leaning back, I\nlet my mind relax. After I woke up from my nap, I vaguely remembered seeing\nsomething like this before...something to do with floats and YAML...lets check\nthe psych  commits to see if anything stands out. \n\nAgain, git to the rescue. Luckily, Github has a great compare ui, which I\nutilized like so to compare the tags\n[https://github.com/ruby/psych/compare/v2.0.17...v2.1.0]. And now that  looks\npromising \n\n\"Support YAML 1.2 Core Schema.\"Looking through that commit, and the issue\nlinked, I found myself in the YAML spec. Oh lord.\n\nWell it actually wasn't all that bad. I learned that YAML is crazy! But more\nimportantly, I learned that a new part of the spec changes the behavior for\nrecognizing floats, making strings starting with a zero optionally resolved as\nfloats via some implicit typecasting. And sure enough, with this commit\n[https://github.com/ruby/psych/commit/b737f0811a9687cf86f44f0a35f61cbde9eac673],\npsych was wrapping value starting in zeros in quotes. \n\n\nAnd that was more spec compliant, thought it threw us off.
