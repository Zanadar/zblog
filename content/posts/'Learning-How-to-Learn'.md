'Learning how to learn', by Barbara Oakley, is a compendium of techniques for
learning effectively or more effectively, backed by neuroscience and cognitive
psychology. Increasing ones ability to learn speeds up your knowledge
compounding rate, and is time magnificently well spent.

 1. Know of and take advantage of the different modes of the brain: Diffuse and
    Focussed. If you're learning something totally new or you're stuck on a
    problem, take a break of some sort to allow diffuse mode to do its work.
 2. Pomodoro  technique is useful for giving your brain adequate focus and break
    time to integrate new information. It can also be useful for overcoming
    procrastination
 3. Exercise: it increases your memory and ability to learn new things
 4. Re-reading and highlighting aren't as effective as studying and then
    attempting to recall  directly the content of the material you're studying
    (page, video, etc).
 5. Practice and review  of material are key to deeper mastery
 6. Self knowledge: Sometimes people who learn more slowly learn more deeply.
    Sometimes those with poor working memories are creative. Sometimes super
    focus and strong working memory block creativity by preventing associative
    thinking. Sometimes learning to rapidly can lead to incorrect conclusions or
    superficial understanding.
