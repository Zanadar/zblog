I'm Zander Mackie. I work in tech, on cloud stuff and security, but I'm more
interested in people and bugs than bits. I want to be Dan Geer when I grow up.

In past lives, I studied music with monks in mountains, crafted cave-aged
cheese, and edited evil advertisments. You could say I've seen a lot. I don't
know if I'm old, wise, and sad yet, but I've got some grey hairs to prove it.
