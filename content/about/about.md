I'm Zander. I've worked in tech for a few years, lately in the cloud and container space. I'm currently a PM at Pivotal working on [Cloud Native Buildpacks](buildpacks.io). Before I was a software engineer I had a motley path. I've done:
- Dishwashing
- Van driving
- Photo book preparation
- Radio news anchoring
- Video editing
- Failed philosophy studenting
- Fried chicken sandwich making
- Cheesemongering and cheesemaking
- Hospice cook
- Artist assisting (including scat identification)
